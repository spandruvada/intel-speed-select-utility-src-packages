This is a source package for intel-speed-select utility for building
outside of the linux kernel source tree.

This source is same as what can be found at
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
under tools/power/x86/intel-speed-select folder. But there is a lag
in merging to mainline linux git, so they may differ for some time.

This utility can always be built from the kernel source tree.
Some users prefer building outside the kernel source tree. So there
is a difference in Makefile.

To build this source, you need "gcc" and "make" commands on your platform.
Download the *.tar.gz file and use tar xvf to decompress.
Then simply use "make".
